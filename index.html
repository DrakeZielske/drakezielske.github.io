	<p>We start with one of the more controversial videos on youtube, but not for it's content, as it is completly riveting, but for its length. Many youtubers have complained that this video is, in fact, not long enough. 
	Silence is a very important part of our lives, yet many would argue that 10 hours is not enough.</p>

	<p>Our next video not only encaptulates how YouTube can be used as an educational website, but also how to properly title videos. The content in this video is very exciting, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire
	1:06. Coupled with the content, the title for this video is definitely not a typo, which is a key for many popular videos.</p>

  <p>So I haven't actually watched this video, but it is called "Best Shark Attack Video Ever" so I assume its good.</p>
